<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Genome Sequencing Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whole-Genome Sequencing</li><li>Whole exome Sequencing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The genome sequencing service market is primarily categorized into whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing involves mapping the entire DNA sequence of an organism, providing comprehensive genetic information, including non-coding regions. In contrast, whole-exome sequencing targets only the protein-coding regions of the genome, which represent about 1-2% of the total DNA but contain most known disease-related variants. Both types facilitate advances in personalized medicine, genetic research, and diagnostics by offering insights into genetic predispositions and conditions.</p></p>
